knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0001 SECTION TWO OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY BRANCH OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE PRESENTS THREE STAGES WHICH IN THEIR LOGICAL RELATION ARE SUCCESSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0003 THE FIRST IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE SENSIBLE CHARACTER AND ORDER OF THE PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0004 THIS IS NATURAL HISTORY IN THE ORIGINAL SENSE OF THE TERM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0005 AND HERE NOTHING BUT OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT AVAIL US
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0006 THE SECOND IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANT RELATIONS OF THE PHENOMENA THUS DEFINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0007 AND THEIR EXPRESSION IN RULES OR LAWS THE THIRD IS THE EXPLICATION OF THESE PARTICULAR LAWS BY DEDUCTION FROM THE MOST GENERAL LAWS OF MATTER AND MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0008 THE LAST TWO STAGES CONSTITUTE NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN ITS ORIGINAL SENSE IN THIS REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0009 THE INVENTION OF VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES IS NOT ONLY PERMISSIBLE BUT IS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF PROGRESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0010 HISTORICALLY NO BRANCH OF SCIENCE HAS FOLLOWED THIS ORDER OF GROWTH BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0011 FROM THE DAWN OF EXACT KNOWLEDGE TO THE PRESENT DAY OBSERVATION EXPERIMENT AND SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0012 HAVE GONE HAND IN HAND AND WHENEVER SCIENCE HAS HALTED OR STRAYED FROM THE RIGHT PATH IT HAS BEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0013 EITHER BECAUSE ITS VOTARIES HAVE BEEN CONTENT WITH MERE UNVERIFIED OR UNVERIFIABLE SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0014 AND THIS IS THE COMMONEST CASE BECAUSE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT ARE HARD WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0015 WHILE SPECULATION IS AMUSING OR IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE THE ACCUMULATION OF DETAILS OF OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0016 HAS FOR A TIME EXCLUDED SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0017 THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE SINCE THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT MEN HAVE GRADUALLY LEARNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0018 TO LAY ASIDE THE CONSIDERATION OF UNVERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES TO GUIDE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT BY VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0019 AND TO CONSIDER THE LATTER NOT AS IDEAL TRUTHS THE REAL ENTITIES OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD BEHIND PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0020 BUT AS A SYMBOLICAL LANGUAGE BY THE AID OF WHICH NATURE CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0021 APPREHENSIBLE BY OUR INTELLECTS AND IF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0022 ATTAINED DIMENSIONS BEYOND ALL FORMER PRECEDENT AND CAN EXHIBIT ACHIEVEMENTS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN ANY FORMER SUCH PERIOD CAN SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0023 IT IS BECAUSE ABLE MEN ANIMATED BY THE TRUE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT CAREFULLY TRAINED IN THE METHOD OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0024 AND HAVING AT THEIR DISPOSAL IMMENSELY IMPROVED APPLIANCES HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE BOUNDARIES OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0025 IN GREATER NUMBER THAN DURING ANY PREVIOUS HALF CENTURY OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0026 I HAVE SAID THAT OUR EPOCH CAN PRODUCE ACHIEVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE OF GREATER MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0027 THAN ANY OTHER HAS TO SHOW ADVISEDLY AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE THREE GREAT PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME WHICH JUSTIFY THE ASSERTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0028 ONE OF THESE IS THAT DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER WHICH FOR WANT OF A BETTER NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0029 I WILL CALL MOLECULAR THE SECOND IS THE DOCTRINE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0030 THE THIRD IS THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION EACH OF THESE WAS FORESHADOWED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0031 MORE OR LESS DISTINCTLY IN FORMER PERIODS OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0032 AND SO FAR IS EITHER FROM BEING THE OUTCOME OF PURELY INDUCTIVE REASONING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0033 THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO OVERRATE THE INFLUENCE OF METAPHYSICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0034 AND EVEN OF THEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THREE THE PECULIAR MERIT OF OUR EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0035 IS THAT IT HAS SHOWN HOW THESE HYPOTHESES CONNECT A VAST NUMBER OF SEEMINGLY INDEPENDENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0036 PARTIAL GENERALISATIONS THAT IT HAS GIVEN THEM THAT PRECISION OF EXPRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0037 WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THEIR EXACT VERIFICATION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0038 THAT IT HAS PRACTICALLY PROVED THEIR VALUE AS GUIDES TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TRUTH ALL THREE DOCTRINES ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0039 AND EACH IS APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE PHYSICAL COSMOS BUT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE NATURE OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0040 THE FIRST TWO GREW MAINLY OUT OF THE CONSIDERATION OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL PHENOMENA WHILE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0041 THE THIRD IN GREAT MEASURE OWES ITS REHABILITATION IF NOT ITS ORIGIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0042 TO THE STUDY OF BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT TRUTHS APPLICABLE IN PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0043 TO MATTER IN GENERAL AND IN PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0044 TO PARTICULAR FORMS OF MATTER HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED BY THE PHYSICISTS AND CHEMISTS THE LAWS OF MOTION OF VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0045 OR MOLAR MATTER HAD BEEN WORKED OUT TO A GREAT DEGREE OF REFINEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0046 AND EMBODIED IN THE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE KNOWN AS MECHANICS HYDROSTATICS AND PNEUMATICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0047 THESE LAWS HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HOLD GOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0048 SO FAR AS THEY COULD BE CHECKED BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0049 ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL SUCH MASSES OF MATTER POSSESSED INERTIA AND WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF ACQUIRING MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0050 IN TWO WAYS FIRSTLY BY IMPACT OR IMPULSE FROM WITHOUT AND SECONDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0051 BY THE OPERATION OF CERTAIN HYPOTHETICAL CAUSES OF MOTION TERMED FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0052 WHICH WERE USUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE RESIDENT IN THE PARTICLES OF THE MASSES THEMSELVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0053 AND TO OPERATE AT A DISTANCE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TEND TO DRAW ANY TWO SUCH MASSES TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0054 OR TO SEPARATE THEM MORE WIDELY WITH RESPECT TO THE ULTIMATE CONSTITUTION OF THESE MASSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0055 THE SAME TWO ANTAGONISTIC OPINIONS WHICH HAD EXISTED SINCE THE TIME OF DEMOCRITUS AND OF ARISTOTLE WERE STILL FACE TO FACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0056 ACCORDING TO THE ONE MATTER WAS DISCONTINUOUS AND CONSISTED OF MINUTE INDIVISIBLE PARTICLES OR ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0057 SEPARATED BY A UNIVERSAL VACUUM ACCORDING TO THE OTHER IT WAS CONTINUOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0058 AND THE FINEST DISTINGUISHABLE OR IMAGINABLE PARTICLES WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE ATTENUATED GENERAL SUBSTANCE OF THE PLENUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0059 A ROUGH ANALOGY TO THE LATTER CASE WOULD BE AFFORDED BY GRANULES OF ICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0060 DIFFUSED THROUGH WATER TO THE FORMER SUCH GRANULES DIFFUSED THROUGH ABSOLUTELY EMPTY SPACE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0061 THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE CHEMISTS HAD ARRIVED AT SEVERAL VERY IMPORTANT GENERALISATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0062 RESPECTING THOSE PROPERTIES OF MATTER WITH WHICH THEY WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0063 HOWEVER PLAINLY PONDERABLE MATTER SEEMED TO BE ORIGINATED AND DESTROYED IN THEIR OPERATIONS THEY PROVED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0064 AS MASS OR BODY IT REMAINED INDESTRUCTIBLE AND INGENERABLE AND THAT SO FAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0065 IT VARIED ONLY IN ITS PERCEPTIBILITY BY OUR SENSES THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION FURTHER PROVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0066 THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE CHEMICALLY SEPARABLE KINDS OF MATTER WERE UNALTERABLE BY ANY KNOWN MEANS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0067 EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY MIGHT BE MADE TO CHANGE THEIR STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0068 FROM SOLID TO FLUID OR VICE VERSA UNLESS THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER KINDS OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0069 AND THAT THE PROPERTIES OF THESE SEVERAL KINDS OF MATTER WERE ALWAYS THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0070 WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN ALL OTHER BODIES WERE FOUND TO CONSIST OF TWO OR MORE OF THESE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0071 WHICH THUS TOOK THE PLACE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS FURTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0072 IT WAS PROVED THAT IN FORMING CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BODIES ALWAYS UNITE IN A DEFINITE PROPORTION BY WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0073 OR IN SIMPLE MULTIPLES OF THAT PROPORTION AND THAT IF ANY ONE BODY WERE TAKEN AS A STANDARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0074 EVERY OTHER COULD HAVE A NUMBER ASSIGNED TO IT AS ITS PROPORTIONAL COMBINING WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0075 IT WAS ON THIS FOUNDATION OF FACT THAT DALTON BASED HIS RE ESTABLISHMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0076 OF THE OLD ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS ON A NEW EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION IT IS OBVIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0077 THAT IF ELEMENTARY MATTER CONSISTS OF INDESTRUCTIBLE AND INDIVISIBLE PARTICLES EACH OF WHICH CONSTANTLY PRESERVES THE SAME WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0078 RELATIVELY TO ALL THE OTHERS COMPOUNDS FORMED BY THE AGGREGATION OF TWO THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0079 FOUR OR MORE SUCH PARTICLES MUST EXEMPLIFY THE RULE OF COMBINATION IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS DEDUCED FROM OBSERVATION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0080 THE MEANWHILE THE GRADUAL RECEPTION OF THE UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0081 NECESSITATED THE ASSUMPTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ETHER FILLING ALL SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0082 BUT WHETHER THIS ETHER WAS TO BE REGARDED AS A STRICTLY MATERIAL AND CONTINUOUS SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0083 WAS AN UNDECIDED POINT AND HENCE THE REVIVED ATOMISM ESCAPED STRANGLING IN ITS BIRTH FOR IT IS CLEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0084 THAT IF THE ETHER IS ADMITTED TO BE A CONTINUOUS MATERIAL SUBSTANCE DEMOCRITIC ATOMISM IS AT AN END
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0085 AND CARTESIAN CONTINUITY TAKES ITS PLACE THE REAL VALUE OF THE NEW ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0086 DID NOT LIE IN THE TWO POINTS WHICH DEMOCRITUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0087 NAMELY THE INDIVISIBILITY OF THE ATOMS AND THE PRESENCE OF AN INTERATOMIC VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0088 BUT IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR MEANS OF ANALYSIS TAKE US
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0089 MATERIAL BODIES CONSIST OF DEFINITE MINUTE MASSES EACH OF WHICH SO FAR AS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES OF DIVISION GO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0090 MAY BE REGARDED AS A UNIT HAVING A PRACTICALLY PERMANENT INDIVIDUALITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0091 JUST AS A MAN IS THE UNIT OF SOCIOLOGY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL FACT OF HIS DIVISIBILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0092 SO SUCH A MINUTE MASS IS THE UNIT OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE THAT SMALLEST MATERIAL PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0093 WHICH UNDER ANY GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES ACTS AS A WHOLE MOLECULE WOULD BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE NAME FOR SUCH A PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0094 UNFORTUNATELY CHEMISTS EMPLOY THIS TERM IN A SPECIAL SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0095 AS A NAME FOR AN AGGREGATION OF THEIR SMALLEST PARTICLES FOR WHICH THEY RETAIN THE DESIGNATION OF ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0096 THE DOCTRINE OF SPECIFIC HEAT ORIGINATED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT MEANS THAT THE SAME MASS OF A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0097 UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES ALWAYS REQUIRES THE SAME QUANTITY OF HEAT TO RAISE IT TO A GIVEN TEMPERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0098 BUT THAT EQUAL MASSES OF DIFFERENT BODIES REQUIRE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES ULTIMATELY IT WAS FOUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0099 THAT THE QUANTITIES OF HEAT REQUIRED TO RAISE EQUAL MASSES OF THE MORE PERFECT GASES THROUGH EQUAL RANGES OF TEMPERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0100 WERE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS THUS A DEFINITE RELATION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0101 AND HEAT THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A LIKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0102 CLOSE RELATION BETWEEN THESE UNITS AND ELECTRICITY THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE COMBINATION OF ANY TWO UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0103 IS SUFFICIENT TO SEPARATE ANY OTHER TWO WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF SUCH DECOMPOSITION THE PHENOMENA OF ISOMORPHISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0104 SHOWED A RELATION BETWEEN THE UNITS AND CRYSTALLINE FORMS CERTAIN UNITS ARE THUS ABLE TO REPLACE OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0105 IN A CRYSTALLINE BODY WITHOUT ALTERING ITS FORM AND OTHERS ARE NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0106 AGAIN THE LAWS OF THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE AND HEAT ON GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0107 THE FACT THAT THEY COMBINE IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS BY VOLUME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0108 AND THAT SUCH PROPORTION BEARS A SIMPLE RELATION TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS ALL HARMONISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0109 WITH THE DALTONIAN HYPOTHESIS AND LED TO THE BOLD SPECULATION KNOWN AS THE LAW OF AVOGADRO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0110 THAT ALL GASEOUS BODIES UNDER THE SAME PHYSICAL CONDITIONS CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0111 IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT WAS FIRST ENUNCIATED THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS INCORRECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0112 PERHAPS IT IS NOT EXACTLY TRUE IN ANY FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0113 BUT IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT CHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0114 WOULD NEVER HAVE ADVANCED TO THEIR PRESENT CONDITION UNLESS IT HAD BEEN ASSUMED TO BE TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0115 ANOTHER IMMENSE SERVICE RENDERED BY DALTON AS A COROLLARY OF THE NEW ATOMIC DOCTRINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0116 WAS THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF SYMBOLIC NOTATION WHICH NOT ONLY MADE THE NATURE OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0117 AND PROCESSES EASILY INTELLIGIBLE AND EASY OF RECOLLECTION BUT BY ITS VERY FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0118 SUGGESTED NEW LINES OF INQUIRY THE ATOMIC NOTATION WAS AS SERVICEABLE TO CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0119 AS THE BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE AND THE CLASSIFICATORY SCHEMATISM OF LINNAEUS WERE TO ZOOELOGY AND BOTANY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THESE ADVANCES AROSE IN ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0120 WHICH ALSO HAS A CLOSE PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0121 IF THE UNIT OF A COMPOUND IS MADE UP BY THE AGGREGATION OF ELEMENTARY UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0122 THE NOTION THAT THESE MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0123 INEVITABLY SUGGESTS ITSELF AND SUCH PHENOMENA AS DOUBLE DECOMPOSITION POINTED NOT ONLY TO THE EXISTENCE OF A MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0124 BUT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING A MOLECULAR FABRIC WITHOUT DESTROYING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0125 BY TAKING OUT SOME OF THE COMPONENT UNITS AND REPLACING THEM BY OTHERS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0126 CLASS OF NEUTRAL SALTS FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDES A GREAT NUMBER OF BODIES IN MANY WAYS SIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0127 IN WHICH THE BASIC MOLECULES OR THE ACID MOLECULES MAY BE REPLACED BY OTHER BASIC
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0128 AND OTHER ACID MOLECULES WITHOUT ALTERING THE NEUTRALITY OF THE SALT JUST AS A CUBE OF BRICKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0129 REMAINS A CUBE SO LONG AS ANY BRICK THAT IS TAKEN OUT IS REPLACED BY ANOTHER OF THE SAME SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0130 WHATEVER ITS WEIGHT OR OTHER PROPERTIES MAY BE FACTS OF THIS KIND GAVE RISE TO THE CONCEPTION OF TYPES OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0131 JUST AS THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNITY IN DIVERSITY OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE SPECIES OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0132 AND ANIMALS GAVE RISE TO THE NOTION OF BIOLOGICAL TYPES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0133 THE NOTATION OF CHEMISTRY ENABLED THESE IDEAS TO BE REPRESENTED WITH PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0134 AND THEY ACQUIRED AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHEN THE IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF ANALYSIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0135 WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0136 ENABLED THE COMPOSITION OF THE SO CALLED ORGANIC BODIES TO BE DETERMINED WITH RAPIDITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0137 AND PRECISION G AT PRESENT MORE ORGANIC ANALYSES ARE MADE IN A SINGLE DAY THAN WERE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE LIEBIG'S TIME IN A WHOLE YEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0138 A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS CONTAIN NOT MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0139 OF WHICH CARBON IS THE CHIEF BUT THEIR NUMBER IS VERY GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0140 AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES IS ASTONISHING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0141 THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE PROPORTION OF EACH ELEMENT IN THESE COMPOUNDS AFFORDS LITTLE OR NO HELP
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0142 TOWARDS ACCOUNTING FOR THEIR DIVERSITIES WIDELY DIFFERENT BODIES BEING OFTEN VERY SIMILAR OR EVEN IDENTICAL IN THAT RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0143 AND IN THE LAST CASE THAT OF ISOMERIC COMPOUNDS THE APPEAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0144 TO DIVERSITY OF ARRANGEMENT OF THE IDENTICAL COMPONENT UNITS WAS THE ONLY OBVIOUS WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0145 HERE AGAIN HYPOTHESIS PROVED TO BE OF GREAT VALUE NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0146 ONLY WAS THE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF DIVERSITY OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE SUCCESSFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0147 BUT THE STUDY OF THE PROCESS OF TAKING TO PIECES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0148 LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE WAY TO PUT TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0149 AND VAST NUMBERS OF COMPOUNDS SOME OF THEM PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ONLY AS PRODUCTS OF THE LIVING ECONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0150 HAVE THUS BEEN ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRUCTED CHEMICAL WORK AT THE PRESENT DAY IS TO A LARGE EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0151 SYNTHETIC OR CREATIVE THAT IS TO SAY THE CHEMIST DETERMINES THEORETICALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0152 THAT CERTAIN NON EXISTENT COMPOUNDS OUGHT TO BE PRODUCIBLE AND HE PROCEEDS TO PRODUCE THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0153 IT IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OUR EPOCH HAVE PASSED INTO THIS DEDUCTIVE AND SYNTHETIC STAGE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE NAME OF THE NEW CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0154 WHICH THEY COMMONLY RECEIVE BUT THIS NEW CHEMISTRY HAS GROWN UP BY THE HELP OF HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0155 SUCH AS THOSE OF DALTON AND OF AVOGADRO AND THAT SINGULAR CONCEPTION OF BONDS INVENTED TO COLLIGATE THE FACTS OF VALENCY OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0156 ATOMICITY THE FIRST OF WHICH TOOK SOME TIME TO MAKE ITS WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0157 WHILE THE SECOND FELL INTO OBLIVION FOR MANY YEARS AFTER IT WAS PROPOUNDED FOR LACK OF EMPIRICAL JUSTIFICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0158 AS FOR THE THIRD IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF ANYONE REGARDS IT AS MORE THAN A TEMPORARY CONTRIVANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0159 BUT SOME OF THESE HYPOTHESES HAVE DONE YET FURTHER SERVICE COMBINING THEM WITH THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0160 AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0161 WHICH ARE ALSO PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME PHYSICISTS HAVE ARRIVED AT AN ENTIRELY NEW CONCEPTION OF THE NATURE OF GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0162 AND OF THE RELATION OF THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS OF MATTER TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0163 THE CONDUCT OF GASES UNDER VARYING PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE THEIR DIFFUSIBILITY THEIR RELATION TO RADIANT HEAT AND TO LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0164 THE EVOLUTION OF HEAT WHEN BODIES COMBINE THE ABSORPTION OF HEAT WHEN THEY ARE DISSOCIATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0165 AND A HOST OF OTHER MOLECULAR PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE DEDUCIBLE FROM THE DYNAMICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0166 AND STATICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH APPLY TO MOLAR MOTION AND REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0167 AND THE TENDENCY OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE IS CLEARLY TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0168 OF THE INFINITELY LITTLE AS IT ALREADY HAS REDUCED THOSE OF THE INFINITELY GREAT WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0169 TO QUESTIONS OF MECHANICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0170 IN THE MEANTIME THE PRIMITIVE ATOMIC THEORY WHICH HAS SERVED AS THE SCAFFOLDING FOR THE EDIFICE OF MODERN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0171 HAS BEEN QUIETLY DISMISSED I CANNOT DISCOVER THAT ANY CONTEMPORARY PHYSICIST OR CHEMIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0172 BELIEVES IN THE REAL INDIVISIBILITY OF ATOMS OR IN AN INTERATOMIC MATTERLESS VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0173 ATOMS APPEAR TO BE USED AS MERE NAMES FOR PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0174 WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN SUBDIVIDED AND MOLECULES FOR PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0175 WHICH ARE AGGREGATES OF THE FORMER AND THESE INDIVIDUALISED PARTICLES ARE SUPPOSED TO MOVE IN AN ENDLESS OCEAN OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0176 A VASTLY MORE SUBTLE MATTER THE ETHER IF THIS ETHER IS A CONTINUOUS SUBSTANCE THEREFORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0177 WE HAVE GOT BACK FROM THE HYPOTHESIS OF DALTON TO THAT OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0178 BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS GOING TO MAKE A STILL FURTHER JOURNEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0179 AND IN FORM IF NOT ALTOGETHER IN SUBSTANCE TO RETURN TO THE POINT OF VIEW OF ARISTOTLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0180 THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE SO CALLED ELEMENTARY BODIES NOW KNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0181 HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF OUR EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0182 AND IT HAD BECOME APPARENT THAT THEY WERE BY NO MEANS EQUALLY SIMILAR OR DISSIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0183 BUT THAT SOME OF THEM AT ANY RATE CONSTITUTED GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0184 THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF WHICH WERE AS MUCH LIKE ONE ANOTHER AS THEY WERE UNLIKE THE REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0185 CHLORINE IODINE BROMINE AND FLUORINE THUS FORMED A VERY DISTINCT GROUP SULPHUR AND SELENIUM ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0186 BORON AND SILICON ANOTHER POTASSIUM SODIUM AND LITHIUM ANOTHER AND SO ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0187 IN SOME CASES THE ATOMIC WEIGHTS OF SUCH ALLIED BODIES WERE NEARLY THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0188 OR COULD BE ARRANGED IN SERIES WITH LIKE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL TERMS IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0189 THE ELEMENTS AFFORDED INDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF A CLASSIFICATION IN NATURAL GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0190 SUCH AS THOSE INTO WHICH ANIMALS AND PLANTS FALL RECENTLY THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP AFRESH WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0191 A RESULT WHICH MAY BE STATED ROUGHLY IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS IF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0192 THE SIXTY FIVE OR SIXTY EIGHT RECOGNISED ELEMENTS ARE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER OF THEIR ATOMIC WEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0193 FROM HYDROGEN THE LIGHTEST AS UNITY TO URANIUM THE HEAVIEST AS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0194 THE SERIES DOES NOT EXHIBIT ONE CONTINUOUS PROGRESSIVE MODIFICATION IN THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF ITS SEVERAL TERMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0195 BUT BREAKS UP INTO A NUMBER OF SECTIONS IN EACH OF WHICH THE SEVERAL TERMS PRESENT ANALOGIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0196 WITH THE CORRESPONDING TERMS OF THE OTHER SERIES THUS THE WHOLE SERIES DOES NOT RUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0197 A B D E F G H I K ETCETERA BUT A B C D
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0198 CAPITAL A CAPITAL B CAPITAL C CAPITAL D ALPHA BETA GAMMA DELTA ETCETERA SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0199 THAT IT IS SAID TO EXPRESS A PERIODIC LAW OF RECURRENT SIMILARITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0200 OR THE RELATION MAY BE EXPRESSED IN ANOTHER WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0201 IN EACH SECTION OF THE SERIES THE ATOMIC WEIGHT IS GREATER THAN IN THE PRECEDING SECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0202 SO THAT IF W IS THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE FIRST SEGMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0203 W PLUS X WILL REPRESENT THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0204 AND W PLUS X PLUS Y THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT AND SO ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0205 THEREFORE THE SECTIONS MAY BE REPRESENTED AS PARALLEL SERIES THE CORRESPONDING TERMS OF WHICH HAVE ANALOGOUS PROPERTIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0206 EACH SUCCESSIVE SERIES STARTING WITH A BODY THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0207 IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY IN THE PRECEDING SERIES IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION

knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0209 W PLUS X COLUMN THREE DELTA GAMMA BETA ALPHA W PLUS X PLUS Y
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0210 THIS IS A CONCEPTION WITH WHICH BIOLOGISTS ARE VERY FAMILIAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0211 ANIMAL AND PLANT GROUPS CONSTANTLY APPEARING AS SERIES OF PARALLEL MODIFICATIONS OF SIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0212 AND YET DIFFERENT PRIMARY FORMS IN THE LIVING WORLD FACTS OF THIS KIND ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN EVOLUTION FROM A COMMON PROTOTYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0213 IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT IN THE NOT LIVING WORLD THEY ARE DEVOID OF SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0214 IS IT NOT POSSIBLE NAY PROBABLE THAT THEY MAY MEAN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR ELEMENTS FROM A PRIMARY UNDIFFERENTIATED FORM OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0215 FIFTY YEARS AGO SUCH A SUGGESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN SCOUTED AS A REVIVAL OF THE DREAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0216 OF THE ALCHEMISTS AT PRESENT IT MAY BE SAID TO BE THE BURNING QUESTION OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0217 IN FACT THE SO CALLED VORTEX RING HYPOTHESIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND REMARKABLE ATTEMPT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0218 TO DEAL WITH MATERIAL UNITS FROM A POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0219 IT SUPPOSES THE ETHER TO BE A UNIFORM SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0220 AND THAT THE ELEMENTARY UNITS ARE BROADLY SPEAKING PERMANENT WHIRLPOOLS OR VORTICES OF THIS ETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0221 THE PROPERTIES OF WHICH DEPEND ON THEIR ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL MODES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0222 IT IS CURIOUS AND HIGHLY INTERESTING TO REMARK THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS REMINDS US NOT ONLY OF THE SPECULATIONS OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0223 BUT OF THOSE OF ARISTOTLE THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE VORTEX RINGS TO THE TOURBILLONS OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0224 IS LITTLE MORE THAN NOMINAL BUT THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE MODERN AND THE ANCIENT NOTION OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND DERIVATIVE MATTER IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0225 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT REAL FOR THIS ETHEREAL URSTOFF OF THE MODERN CORRESPONDS VERY CLOSELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0226 WITH THE PRHOTE HYLE OF ARISTOTLE THE MATERIA PRIMA OF HIS MEDIAEVAL FOLLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0227 WHILE MATTER DIFFERENTIATED INTO OUR ELEMENTS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FIRST STAGE OF PROGRESS TOWARDS THE HESCHHATE HYLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0228 OR FINISHED MATTER OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY IF THE MATERIAL UNITS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF NATURE ARE SPECIALISED PORTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0229 OF A RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS MATERIA PRIMA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0230 WHICH WERE ORIGINATED UNDER CONDITIONS THAT HAVE LONG CEASED TO EXIST AND WHICH REMAIN UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGEABLE UNDER ALL CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0231 WHETHER NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL HITHERTO KNOWN TO US IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SPECULATION THAT THEY MAY BE INDEFINITELY ALTERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0232 OR THAT NEW UNITS MAY BE GENERATED UNDER CONDITIONS YET TO BE DISCOVERED IS PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0233 THEORETICALLY AT ANY RATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0234 THE TRANSMUTABILITY OF THE ELEMENTS IS A VERIFIABLE SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS AND SUCH INQUIRIES AS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN SET AFOOT INTO THE POSSIBLE DISSOCIATIVE ACTION OF THE GREAT HEAT OF THE SUN UPON OUR ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0235 ARE NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE BUT ARE LIKELY TO YIELD RESULTS WHICH WHETHER AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0236 WILL BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE IDEA THAT ATOMS ARE ABSOLUTELY INGENERABLE AND IMMUTABLE MANUFACTURED ARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0237 STANDS ON THE SAME SORT OF FOUNDATION AS THE IDEA THAT BIOLOGICAL SPECIES ARE MANUFACTURED ARTICLES STOOD THIRTY YEARS AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0238 AND THE SUPPOSED CONSTANCY OF THE ELEMENTARY ATOMS DURING THE ENORMOUS LAPSE OF TIME MEASURED BY THE EXISTENCE OF OUR UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0239 IS OF NO MORE WEIGHT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE IN THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0240 IN THE INFINITY OF ANTECEDENT TIME THAN THE CONSTANCY OF SPECIES IN EGYPT SINCE THE DAYS OF RAMESES OR CHEOPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0241 IS EVIDENCE OF THEIR IMMUTABILITY DURING ALL PAST EPOCHS OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0242 IT SEEMS SAFE TO PROPHESY THAT THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE ELEMENTS FROM A PRIMITIVE MATTER WILL IN FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0243 PLAY NO LESS A PART IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0244 THAN THE ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS WHICH TO BEGIN WITH HAD NO GREATER IF SO GREAT AN EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0245 IT MAY PERHAPS OCCUR TO THE READER THAT THE BOASTED PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DOES NOT COME TO MUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0246 IF OUR PRESENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF MATTER ARE EXPRESSIBLE IN TERMS EMPLOYED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO BY THE OLD MASTER OF THOSE THAT KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0247 SUCH A CRITICISM HOWEVER WOULD INVOLVE FORGETFULNESS OF THE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0248 THAT THE CONNOTATION OF THESE TERMS IN THE MIND OF THE MODERN IS ALMOST INFINITELY DIFFERENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0249 FROM THAT WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE MIND OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0250 IN ANTIQUITY THEY MEANT LITTLE MORE THAN VAGUE SPECULATION AT THE PRESENT DAY THEY INDICATE DEFINITE PHYSICAL CONCEPTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0251 SUSCEPTIBLE OF MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT AND GIVING RISE TO INNUMERABLE DEDUCTIONS THE VALUE OF WHICH CAN BE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0252 THE OLD NOTIONS PRODUCED LITTLE MORE THAN FLOODS OF DIALECTICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0253 THE NEW ARE POWERFUL AIDS TOWARDS THE INCREASE OF SOLID KNOWLEDGE EVERYDAY OBSERVATION SHOWS THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0254 OF THE BODIES WHICH COMPOSE THE MATERIAL WORLD SOME ARE IN MOTION AND SOME ARE OR APPEAR TO BE AT REST OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0255 THE BODIES IN MOTION SOME LIKE THE SUN AND STARS EXHIBIT A CONSTANT MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0256 REGULAR IN AMOUNT AND DIRECTION FOR WHICH NO EXTERNAL CAUSE APPEARS OTHERS AS STONES AND SMOKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0257 SEEM ALSO TO MOVE OF THEMSELVES WHEN EXTERNAL IMPEDIMENTS ARE TAKEN AWAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0258 BUT THESE APPEAR TO TEND TO MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE BODIES WE CALL HEAVY SUCH AS STONES DOWNWARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0259 AND THE BODIES WE CALL LIGHT AT LEAST SUCH AS SMOKE AND STEAM UPWARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0260 AND AS WE FURTHER NOTICE THAT THE EARTH BELOW OUR FEET IS MADE UP OF HEAVY MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0261 WHILE THE AIR ABOVE OUR HEADS IS EXTREMELY LIGHT MATTER IT IS EASY TO REGARD THIS FACT AS EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0262 THAT THE LOWER REGION IS THE PLACE TO WHICH HEAVY THINGS TEND THEIR PROPER PLACE IN SHORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0263 WHILE THE UPPER REGION IS THE PROPER PLACE OF LIGHT THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0264 AND TO GENERALISE THE FACTS OBSERVED BY SAYING THAT BODIES WHICH ARE FREE TO MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0265 TEND TOWARDS THEIR PROPER PLACES ALL THESE SEEM TO BE NATURAL MOTIONS DEPENDENT ON THE INHERENT FACULTIES OR TENDENCIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0266 OF BODIES THEMSELVES BUT THERE ARE OTHER MOTIONS WHICH ARE ARTIFICIAL OR VIOLENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0267 AS WHEN A STONE IS THROWN FROM THE HAND OR IS KNOCKED BY ANOTHER STONE IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0268 IN SUCH CASES AS THESE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A STONE IS CAST FROM THE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0269 THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY THE STONE APPEARS TO DEPEND PARTLY ON ITS WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0270 AND PARTLY UPON THE EXERTION OF THE THROWER SO THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE STONE REMAINING THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0271 IT LOOKS AS IF THE MOTIVE POWER COMMUNICATED TO IT WERE MEASURED BY THE DISTANCE TO WHICH THE STONE TRAVELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0272 AS IF IN OTHER WORDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0273 THE POWER NEEDED TO SEND IT A HUNDRED YARDS WAS TWICE AS GREAT AS THAT NEEDED TO SEND IT FIFTY YARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0274 THESE APPARENTLY OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EVERYDAY APPEARANCES OF REST AND MOTION FAIRLY REPRESENT THE STATE OF OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0275 WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND REMAINED DOMINANT UNTIL THE AGE OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0276 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPIA OF NEWTON IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX SEVEN MARKS THE EPOCH AT WHICH THE PROGRESS OF MECHANICAL PHYSICS HAD EFFECTED A COMPLETE REVOLUTION OF THOUGHT ON THESE SUBJECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0277 BY THIS TIME IT HAD BEEN MADE CLEAR THAT THE OLD GENERALISATIONS WERE EITHER INCOMPLETE OR TOTALLY ERRONEOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0278 THAT A BODY ONCE SET IN MOTION WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0279 FOR ANY CONCEIVABLE TIME OR DISTANCE UNLESS IT IS INTERFERED WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0280 THAT ANY CHANGE OF MOTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE WHICH CAUSES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0281 AND TAKES PLACE IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THAT FORCE IS EXERTED AND THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0282 WHEN A BODY IN MOTION ACTS AS A CAUSE OF MOTION ON ANOTHER THE LATTER GAINS AS MUCH AS THE FORMER LOSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0283 AND VICE VERSA IT IS TO BE NOTED HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0284 THAT WHILE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE ANCIENT IDEA OF THE INHERENT TENDENCY TO MOTION OF BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0285 THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH SPONTANEOUS POWER OF MOTION WAS ACCEPTED AS A PHYSICAL AXIOM BY THE MODERNS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0286 THE OLD CONCEPTION VIRTUALLY MAINTAINED ITSELF IS A NEW SHAPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0287 FOR IN SPITE OF NEWTON'S WELL KNOWN WARNING AGAINST THE ABSURDITY OF SUPPOSING THAT ONE BODY CAN ACT ON ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0288 AT A DISTANCE THROUGH A VACUUM THE ULTIMATE PARTICLES OF MATTER WERE GENERALLY ASSUMED TO BE THE SEATS OF PERENNIAL CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0289 OF MOTION TERMED ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES IN VIRTUE OF WHICH ANY TWO SUCH PARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0290 WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL IMPRESSION OF MOTION OR INTERMEDIATE MATERIAL AGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0291 WERE SUPPOSED TO TEND TO APPROACH OR REMOVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0292 AND THIS VIEW OF THE DUALITY OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0293 IS VERY WIDELY HELD AT THE PRESENT DAY ANOTHER IMPORTANT RESULT OF INVESTIGATION ATTAINED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0294 THE PROOF AND QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF PHYSICAL INERTIA IN THE OLD PHILOSOPHY A CURIOUS CONJUNCTION OF ETHICAL AND PHYSICAL PREJUDICES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0295 HAD LED TO THE NOTION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ETHICALLY BAD AND PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTIVE ABOUT MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0296 ARISTOTLE ATTRIBUTES ALL IRREGULARITIES AND APPARENT DYSTELEOLOGIES IN NATURE TO THE DISOBEDIENCE OR SLUGGISH YIELDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0297 OF MATTER TO THE SHAPING AND GUIDING INFLUENCE OF THOSE REASONS AND CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0298 WHICH WERE HYPOTHESIZED IN HIS IDEAL FORMS IN MODERN SCIENCE THE CONCEPTION OF THE INERTIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0299 OR RESISTANCE TO CHANGE OF MATTER IS COMPLEX IN PART IT CONTAINS A COROLLARY FROM THE LAW OF CAUSATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0300 A BODY CANNOT CHANGE ITS STATE IN RESPECT OF REST OR MOTION WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0301 BUT IN PART IT CONTAINS GENERALISATIONS FROM EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0302 ONE OF THESE IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH SUFFICIENT CAUSE RESIDENT IN ANY BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0303 AND THAT THEREFORE IT WILL REST OR CONTINUE IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0304 SO LONG AS NO EXTERNAL CAUSE OF CHANGE ACTS UPON IT THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0305 IS THAT THE EFFECT WHICH THE IMPACT OF A BODY IN MOTION PRODUCES UPON THE BODY ON WHICH IT IMPINGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0306 DEPENDS OTHER THINGS BEING ALIKE ON THE RELATION OF A CERTAIN QUALITY OF EACH WHICH IS CALLED MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0307 GIVEN A CAUSE OF MOTION OF A CERTAIN VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0308 THE AMOUNT OF MOTION MEASURED BY DISTANCE TRAVELLED IN A CERTAIN TIME WHICH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0309 WILL PRODUCE IN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF MATTER SAY A CUBIC INCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0310 IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME BUT DEPENDS ON WHAT THAT MATTER IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0311 A CUBIC INCH OF IRON WILL GO FASTER THAN A CUBIC INCH OF GOLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0312 HENCE IT APPEARS THAT SINCE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF MOTION HAVE EX HYPOTHESI BEEN PRODUCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0313 THE AMOUNT OF MOTION IN A BODY DOES NOT DEPEND ON ITS SPEED ALONE BUT ON SOME PROPERTY OF THE BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0314 TO THIS THE NAME OF MASS HAS BEEN GIVEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0315 SINCE IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT A LARGE QUANTITY OF MATTER MOVING SLOWLY POSSESSES AS MUCH MOTION AS A SMALL QUANTITY MOVING FASTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0316 MASS HAS BEEN HELD TO EXPRESS QUANTITY OF MATTER IT IS FURTHER DEMONSTRABLE THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0317 THE RELATIVE MASS OF ANY TWO BODIES IS EXPRESSED BY THE RATIO OF THEIR WEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0318 WHEN ALL THESE GREAT TRUTHS RESPECTING MOLAR MOTION OR THE MOVEMENTS OF VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE MASSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0319 HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HOLD GOOD NOT ONLY OF TERRESTRIAL BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0320 BUT OF ALL THOSE WHICH CONSTITUTE THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE AND THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MACROCOSM HAD THUS BEEN EXPRESSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0321 BY A GENERAL MECHANICAL THEORY THERE REMAINED A VAST NUMBER OF PHENOMENA SUCH AS THOSE OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0322 HEAT ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM AND THOSE OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES WHICH DO NOT INVOLVE MOLAR MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0323 NEWTON'S CORPUSCULAR THEORY OF LIGHT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH ONE GREAT SERIES OF THESE PHENOMENA ON MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0324 AND IT MAINTAINED ITS GROUND UNTIL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0325 THE UNDULATORY THEORY PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MUCH BETTER WORKING HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0326 HEAT UP TO THAT TIME AND INDEED MUCH LATER WAS REGARDED AS AN IMPONDERABLE SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0327 CALORIC AS A THING WHICH WAS ABSORBED BY BODIES WHEN THEY WERE WARMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0328 AND WAS GIVEN OUT AS THEY COOLED AND WHICH MOREOVER WAS CAPABLE OF ENTERING INTO A SORT OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH THEM AND SO BECOMING LATENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0329 RUMFORD AND DAVY HAD GIVEN A GREAT BLOW TO THIS VIEW OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0330 BY PROVING THAT THE QUANTITY OF HEAT WHICH TWO PORTIONS OF THE SAME BODY COULD BE MADE TO GIVE OUT BY RUBBING THEM TOGETHER WAS PRACTICALLY ILLIMITABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0331 THIS RESULT BROUGHT PHILOSOPHERS FACE TO FACE WITH THE CONTRADICTION OF SUPPOSING THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0332 A FINITE BODY COULD CONTAIN AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF ANOTHER BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0333 BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0334 THAT CLEAR AND UNQUESTIONABLE EXPERIMENTAL PROOF WAS GIVEN OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DEFINITE RELATION BETWEEN MECHANICAL WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0335 AND HEAT THAT SO MUCH WORK ALWAYS GIVES RISE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS TO SO MUCH HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0336 AND SO MUCH HEAT TO SO MUCH MECHANICAL WORK THUS ORIGINATED THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0337 WHICH BECAME THE STARTING POINT OF THE MODERN DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0338 MOLAR MOTION HAD APPEARED TO BE DESTROYED BY FRICTION IT WAS PROVED THAT NO DESTRUCTION TOOK PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0339 BUT THAT AN EXACT EQUIVALENT OF THE ENERGY OF THE LOST MOLAR MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0340 APPEARS AS THAT OF THE MOLECULAR MOTION OR MOTION OF THE SMALLEST PARTICLES OF A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0341 WHICH CONSTITUTES HEAT THE LOSS OF THE MASSES IS THE GAIN OF THEIR PARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0342 BEFORE EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE HOWEVER THE DOCTRINE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY HAD BEEN APPROACHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0343 BACON'S CHIEF CONTRIBUTION TO POSITIVE SCIENCE IS THE HAPPY GUESS FOR THE CONTEXT SHOWS THAT IT WAS LITTLE MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0344 THAT HEAT MAY BE A MODE OF MOTION DESCARTES AFFIRMED THE QUANTITY OF MOTION IN THE WORLD TO BE CONSTANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0345 NEWTON NEARLY GAVE EXPRESSION TO THE COMPLETE THEOREM WHILE RUMFORD'S AND DAVY'S EXPERIMENTS SUGGESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0346 THOUGH THEY DID NOT PROVE THE EQUIVALENCY OF MECHANICAL AND THERMAL ENERGY AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0347 THE DISCOVERY OF VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY AND THE MARVELLOUS DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IN THAT FIELD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0348 EFFECTED BY SUCH MEN AS DAVY FARADAY OERSTED AMPERE AND MELLONI
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0349 HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT A NUMBER OF FACTS WHICH TENDED TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0350 THAT THE SO CALLED FORCES AT WORK IN LIGHT HEAT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0351 CHEMICAL AND IN MECHANICAL OPERATIONS WERE INTIMATELY AND IN VARIOUS CASES QUANTITATIVELY RELATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0352 IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY ONE COULD BE OBTAINED AT THE EXPENSE OF ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0353 AND APPARATUS WAS DEVISED WHICH EXHIBITED THE EVOLUTION OF ALL THESE KINDS OF ACTION FROM ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0354 HENCE THE IDEA OF THE CORRELATION OF FORCES WHICH WAS THE IMMEDIATE FORERUNNER OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0355 IT IS A REMARKABLE EVIDENCE OF THE GREATNESS OF THE PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0356 WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN OUR TIME THAT EVEN THE SECOND EDITION OF THE HISTORY OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0357 WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX CONTAINS NO ALLUSION EITHER TO THE GENERAL VIEW OF THE CORRELATION OF FORCES PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0358 TO THE PUBLICATION IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0359 OF THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS BY WHICH THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT WAS CORRECTLY ASCERTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0360 THIS IS THE MORE CURIOUS AS AMPERE'S HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0361 THAT VIBRATIONS OF MOLECULES CAUSING AND CAUSED BY VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER CONSTITUTE HEAT IS DISCUSSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0362 WHEWELL REMARKS A PROPOS OF BACON'S DEFINITION OF HEAT THAT IT IS AN EXPANSIVE RESTRAINED MOTION MODIFIED IN CERTAIN WAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0363 AND EXERTED IN THE SMALLER PARTICLES OF THE BODY THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0364 ALTHOUGH THE EXACT NATURE OF HEAT IS STILL AN OBSCURE AND CONTROVERTED MATTER THE SCIENCE OF HEAT NOW CONSISTS OF MANY IMPORTANT TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0365 AND THAT TO NONE OF THESE TRUTHS IS THERE ANY APPROXIMATION IN BACON'S ESSAY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0366 POINT OF FACT BACON'S STATEMENT HOWEVER MUCH OPEN TO CRITICISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0367 DOES CONTAIN A DISTINCT APPROXIMATION TO THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0368 RESPECTING HEAT WHICH HAD BEEN DISCOVERED WHEN WHEWELL WROTE SUCH A FAILURE ON THE PART OF A CONTEMPORARY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0369 OF GREAT ACQUIREMENTS AND REMARKABLE INTELLECTUAL POWERS TO READ THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0370 IS A LESSON AND A WARNING WORTHY OF BEING DEEPLY PONDERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/mfc/adv0371 BY ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO PROGNOSTICATE THE COURSE OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS END OF SECTION TWO
