A corpus format defines how a corpus is saved on disk. For the use with this library some formats were specifically developed:

* DefaultLoader :class:`pingu.corpus.io.DefaultLoader`
* Broadcast :class:`pingu.corpus.io.BroadcastLoader`

Furthermore there exist readers and writers for other formats or specific datasets.
For a list of available readers and writers check :ref:`io_implementations`.
