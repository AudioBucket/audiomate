A corpus format defines how a corpus is saved on disk. For the use with this library some formats were specifically developed:

* Default :class:`pingu.corpus.io.DefaultReader` / :class:`pingu.corpus.io.DefaultWriter`
* Broadcast :class:`pingu.corpus.io.BroadcastReader`

Furthermore there exist downloaders, readers and writers for other formats or specific datasets.
For a list of available downloaders, readers and writers check :ref:`io_implementations`.
